        "\n",
        "Splitting a time series dataset into training and testing components is crucial for model development and evaluation. Compared to other forms of data that is often used in various application domains of machine learning, time series data needs to be handled differently. In this assignment, we will explore three different strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Simple static split\n",
        "2. Rolling window\n",
        "3. Expanding window\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Simple Static Split\n",
        "This is the most straightforward method, and it is usually suitable for long time series data: allocate a fixed first part of your dataset to training and the remainder to testing. For example, you may want to use the first 70% for training and the remaining 30% for testing, or 80% for training and the remaining 20% for testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Rolling Window\n",
        "This method is extremely useful when you want to develop and evaluate a model that adapts changing conditions over time: move the training window through the dataset, predicting one step ahead each time, and sliding the training dataset by one step after each prediction. This technique is more helpful in forecasting where the recent past might be more relevant than the distant past.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Expanding Window\n",
        "This is similar to the rolling window, but instead of moving the start of the training set forward, you expand the size of the training set by only moving the end. That is, you incrementally expand the size of your training data: start with a fixed predetermined size for the training set, and expand it by a fixed number or proportion each time until only enough data is left for one final test.\n",

Take a brief look at the [Shapiro-Wilk test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test) to understand its purpose, and then use it to check if the residual series due to your best fitting model is a normal distribution. Show the code for this (it will probably just be a few lines of your code, invoking a function from `scipy` or another similar library), and also report the $p$-value and the significance level. Clearly state your null hypothesis and what your test result means with regard to the null hypothesis.\n",
